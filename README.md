# Surface2SurfaceDists_NNeighbors
Surface2SurfaceDists_NNeighbors is an Imaris extension that calculates the distances from every surface within a Surface object (reference surface) to every surface within a different Surface Object (target surface). Additionally, this extension finds the number of nearest neighbor target surfaces from a reference surface within a user specified search radius (um). The output results are saved to an excel spreadsheet. If the data set has time points, each time point is saved as an additional Sheet in Excel.&amp;nbsp;
